12.2. Creating Virtual Environments
The module used to create and manage virtual environments is called venv. venv will usually install the most recent version of Python that you have available. If you have multiple versions of Python on your system, you can select a specific Python version by running python3 or whichever version you want.

To create a virtual environment, decide upon a directory where you want to place it, and run the venv module as a script with the directory path:

python3 -m venv tutorial-env
This will create the tutorial-env directory if it doesnâ€™t exist, and also create directories inside it containing a copy of the Python interpreter, the standard library, and various supporting files
